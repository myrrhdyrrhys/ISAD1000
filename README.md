Introduction to Software Engineering (Year 1, Semester 1)

An introductory unit for SE students, giving us a brief overview of important concepts of software engineering such as analysing projects for requirements (types of requirements, user stories, etc.), using Git for logging/organising our work, scheduling work and concepts such as sprints and Kanban, and testing methods (e.g. whitebox).

The files in this repository were sample ones simply given to use to help us understand how to use Git to make branches for a project and commit changes.
